# How To For Different Servers


Hi There !!

This repository has been created to document setup and administration of different servers. 

While this is not a comprehensive list, it contains servers that I have learnt and practiced on. 

Also it would be wise to note that I am not an expert. Documentation here is provided solely for reference.

The machine that is used for all servers is RHEL8.

* [Apache](/servers/apache.md)

* [Nginx](/servers/nginx.md)

* [Mariadb](/servers/mariadb.md)

* [Squid](/servers/squid.md)

* [Post Fix](/servers/postfix.md)
