# Servers

Welcome !!

This repository has been created to document setup and administration of different servers. 

While this is not a comprehensive list, it contains servers that I have learnt and practiced on. 

Also it would be wise to note that I am not an expert. Documentation here is provided solely to for reference.

The machine that is used for all servers is RHEL8.
